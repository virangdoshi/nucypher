Legacy NuCypher Stakes
----------------------

As part of the merger to the Threshold Network, if you have an existing legacy NU stake,
you can now withdraw it (and then upgrade the liquid tokens to T and stake). If you are
subject to a vesting agreement, your unvested stake will not be immediately withdrawable
but you can still stake it in Threshold!

Both options are available from the `NU dashboard <https://stake.nucypher.network/manage>`_:

* `Withdraw available NU <https://stake.nucypher.network/manage/withdraw>`_
* `Stake unvested NU on Threshold <https://stake.nucypher.network/manage/stake>`_


Upgrading to T
--------------

The Threshold Network Token (`T <https://etherscan.io/address/0xCdF7028ceAB81fA0C6971208e83fa7872994beE5>`_) is
the work token for staking on the Threshold Network, and
allows for participation in `DAO governance <https://blog.threshold.network/thresholds-governance-structure-and-the-upcoming-council-elections/>`_.

The `Threshold Network Dashboard <https://dashboard.threshold.network/upgrade.>`_ can be used to upgrade from NU to T.

The upgrade from NU to T is also available via directly interacting with the vending machine smart contracts
deployed on mainnet. The NU -> T vending machine contract address is https://etherscan.io/address/0x1CCA7E410eE41739792eA0A24e00349Dd247680e.

.. note::

    1 NU = 3.259242493160745 T


.. important::

    The vending machine contract uses a static conversion ratios and remain available indefinitely, so
    please be safe, take your time, and confirm everything!
